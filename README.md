Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) has
rapidly emerged as a vital instrument in enhancing human-
computer interactions. However, concerns about the fairness and
biases of these ERC systems persist and remain to be addressed
by assessing their robustness. This study presents a methodology
to analyze the robustness and bias of an ERC system by including
complexities of user input with varying English language profi-
ciency. We develop a novel, hybrid approach to create text perturbations by combining natural language generation techniques
with rule-based constraints to simulate language proficiency
levels. Specifically, we utilize the capabilities of GPT-3 to generate
text modifications based on language proficiency characteristics
introduced by the internationally recognized Common European
Framework of Reference (CEFR). Based on the application of the
widely-used COSMIC model, our robustness analysis discloses
that the ERC system’s performance decreased as language pro-
ficiency diminished. Hence, this study demonstrates the presence
and implications of language proficiency bias in ERC systems,
resulting in discriminatory consequences for non-native English
speakers. Overall, our perturbation exhibits versatility for diverse
analysis objectives. For instance, it allows investigating gender
bias and examining unilateral linguistic bias involving native
and non-native speakers. By making our implementation publicly
accessible, we aim to foster the advancement of fair ERC systems.
